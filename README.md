# Pokemon CRUD

![](https://i.imgur.com/rRKtN1B.jpg)

Create a full server that can GET and DELETE Pokemon using a separate `controller`  and `models` folders and their corresponding files. 

## Setup the server

## Setup/Configure the pokemon routes in the routes folder

The routes should handle the following:

| Method | URL       | Code | Response         |
| ------ | --------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| GET    | /pokemon     | 200  | Array of objects |
| GET    | /pokemon/:id | 200  | Object           |
| DELETE | /pokemon/:id | 200  | Deleted object   |

## Setup/Configure the controller in the controllers folder

## Test each Route using Postman
